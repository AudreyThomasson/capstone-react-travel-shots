# TravelShots
-Front-End Capstone project designed to demonstrate what I learned during the first 3 months at Nashville Software School.

The Cloudinary image link and additional data is stored on a JSON server. Styled with Semantic UI. TravelShots- my a photo shoot shot list creator for traveling photographers.
